<br><b>Dresden Files Geek Code</b><p>
This project is an attempt to consolidate the numerous theories and positions available on the Dresden Files subreddit.  
By creating a 1-2 line signature, a poster would be able to give an overview his/her stance on a various number of 
Dresdenverse issues.  Basically, you can rate yourself in a number of categories, with the examples given to show what 
the range looks like.

Generally, a '+' means you feel strongly about that issue, and '-' means you're against that issue.  '!'
 means something like "militantly against" and '?' is used to signify confusion about a certain issue.

2.  General Info
-------------------------------------

BK: How many times have you read the books?

BK++++:  I have an mp3 player by my bed that plays the audio books in a continuous loop while I sleep.  The books are imprinted in my mind, and I can recite them by heart, backwards or forwards.

BK+++:  I have read each chapter at least five times in order categorical, just to make sure no nuance escapes my eye.  I can quote entire passages by heart.

BK++:  I have re-read entire books more than once in an effort to glean extra information in hindsight.

BK+:  I have read all the book at least once.  I've re-read some of my favorite scenes.
